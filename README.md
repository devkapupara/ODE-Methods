# ODE-Methods
A collection of various methods to find solution to Ordinary Differential Equations.

1. Adams-Bashforth Method: Includes Two, Three, Four, Five Step method and also the Predictor-Corrector method
2. Milne-Simpson's Method
3. Euler's Method: Includes the Analytical method, plain Estimation and Modified Euler's Method.
4. Runge-Kutta Fourth-Order: Includes Estimator and Analytical method.
5. Runge-Kutta 4 for Systems of ODE: A generic implementation for RK-4 Systems of ODE. You need to specify the functions manually.
6. Midpoint Method.
7. Taylor's Estimation
